\arguments{
\item{graph}{An \code{igraph} object (currently unused internally; reserved for
future graph-based heuristics). Must be present in the worker environment.}

\item{adj_matrix}{Adjacency matrix (from \code{\link[=prepare_districts]{prepare_districts()}}).}

\item{num_districts}{Integer. Number of consolidated districts to form.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric. Pheromone exponent (influence of pheromone trails).}

\item{beta}{Numeric. Heuristic exponent (influence of node degree).}

\item{rho}{Numeric. Evaporation rate (not used directly here; used in outer
loop).}

\item{sf_data}{The \code{sf} spatial data frame (with \code{center_x}, \code{center_y}, and
a total column). Must be exported to the parallel worker environment.}

\item{total_col}{Character. Name of the total enrollment column.}

\item{max_district_size}{Numeric. Maximum enrollment per new district.}

\item{seed_districts}{Integer vector of length \code{num_districts} giving the
starting node index for each new district.}

\item{iteration}{Integer. Current iteration number (informational).}

\item{search_radius}{Numeric. Maximum centroid distance (CRS units) an ant
will consider when expanding a district.}
}
\value{
An integer vector of length \code{n} (number of school districts) where
each element gives the consolidated district (1 to \code{num_districts}) that
the school district is assigned to. May contain \code{NA} for unassigned nodes
if recycling fails.
}
\description{
This function is called internally by \code{\link[=aco_districting]{aco_districting()}} inside a parallel
worker. It builds a complete district assignment for one ant by:
\enumerate{
\item Seeding each target district with a starting node.
\item Growing contiguous clusters greedily using pheromone and degree heuristics.
\item Recycling any unassigned nodes into existing districts.
}
}

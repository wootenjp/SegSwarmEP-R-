Description: Implements a swarm-based optimization heuristic (SegSwarmEP) for
    redistricting school districts with the goal of reducing racial and
    socioeconomic segregation. The algorithm minimizes the Exposure-Proportion
    (EP) segregation index by iteratively reassigning school districts to
    regional groupings, subject to geographic contiguity constraints.
    Developed as part of a dissertation examining the desegregation of
    New Jersey school districts through voluntary regionalization, the package
    is designed so that stakeholders in any state can evaluate proposals for
    consolidating or regionalizing school districts.

Title: Ant Colony Optimization for School District Redistricting to Reduce Segregation
Version: 0.1.0

Description: Implements an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm for redistricting
    school districts to minimize racial and demographic segregation, as measured by
    Theil's H information index. The algorithm respects geographic contiguity
    constraints, optimizes compactness (Polsby-Popper score), and uses adaptive
    elite pheromone scheduling. Designed to work with any state or regional dataset
    provided as an 'sf' spatial data frame, making it applicable nationwide for
    school desegregation planning.
